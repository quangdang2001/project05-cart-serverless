# Project: Serverless Cart

Description:
The Serverless Cart is a project designed to showcase a serverless architecture for managing shopping carts. The system allows users to create and manage shopping carts, update item images, delete carts, and retrieve cart information while implementing authorization to ensure users can only access their own carts.

# Functionalities:

## Create Cart:

Users can create a shopping cart specifying the cart's name, description, price, and quantity for each item.

## Update Cart Item Image:

Users have the ability to update the image associated with an item in their cart.

## Delete Cart:

Users can delete their shopping cart, removing all items and associated information.

## Get Cart:

Users can retrieve their cart, displaying its name, description, price, and quantity for each item.

## Authorization:

The system implements authorization features to ensure that users can only access and manage their own carts. Access to cart information is restricted to the cart's owner, providing a secure and personalized shopping experience.

This project demonstrates the efficient use of serverless architecture to manage shopping carts, enhancing security and user experience by implementing proper authorization mechanisms.
